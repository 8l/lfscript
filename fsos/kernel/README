NOTES:
- Items in the list prefixed with "(defconfig)" were already selected by
  default, after 'make ARCH=i386 defconfig'.
- Any feature not on this list is configured as in 'make ARCH=i386 defconfig' or
  'make ARCH=x86_64 defconfig'.
- The kernel used for LiveCD's might also include some kind of Union filesystem.
- Drivers selected to support a specific machine have a label (prefix "***").
  Those labels describe the machines on which LFScript is tested.


==========================================
Considerations for making these selections
==========================================

Booting from CD/DVD:
* fsOS should be able to read CD-ROM and DVD discs
* fsOS should be able to read and write SquashFS filesystem images

System transference:
* fsOS should be able to read USB storage devices
* fsOS should be able to read and write to ext2, ext3, ext4 & btrfs filesystems
* fsOS should be able to read and write to Windows (FAT & NTFS) filesystems

System support:
* fsOS should be able to run on i486 systems
* fsOS should include drivers to be able to run on a recent VirtualBox VM
* fsOS should include drivers to be able to run on a recent VMware VM

Misc:
* Kernel should have KVM support for virtualization
