     *    with errors which LFScript will interpret as compilation failures.
     *    To avoid these issues, don't run test suites.
     *
     * 2) They build supplemental documentation which requires the presence of
     *    additional software. In stead of adding Doxygen and Tex as a
     *    dependency to every script that can build extra documentation (which
     *    makes the building of a system unneccessarily complex and bloated) we
     *    simply don't build the extra documentation and save space.
     *    Documentation is available on the internet anyway...
     *
     * 3) It contains only a configuration example, sometimes with placeholders.
     *
     * 4) It requires software that is not a direct dependency to be installed,
     *    and the commands are not required to build a properly working copy of
     *    the software.
     *
     * 5) It is superfluous. For example 'ldconfig' is executed by LFScript
     *    after the installation of each package, regardless of it's presence
     *    in a script.
