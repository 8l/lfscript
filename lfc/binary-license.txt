In order to remove the need to install a Java Virtual Machine and a large class
library to be able to run LFClass (both on the host system and on the client
system that you are building with LFScript), a small virtual machine called
"Avian" has been precompiled and distributed with LFClass for 32-bit and 64-bit
Intel CPU architectures.

The 'build.sh' script can create two types of binaries; 'vm-<arch>' contains a
generic copy of Avian and can also be used to launch Java programs beyond
LFClass. 'lfclass-<arch>' also has LFClass embedded and therefore behaves like
a normal application (and can not be used to launch other Java programs).

This document contains a list of the applications used to create these binary
files and the Open Source licenses which therefore apply to them.

Note that the source code of LFClass itself is only MIT (Expat) licensed.
The other licenses described in this document only apply to the precompiled
binary executable file (and also NOT to the *.jar file).
